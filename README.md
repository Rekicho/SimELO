# SimELO

Simulate remaining games of a football league using clubs' ELO Rating (obtained from [clubelo.com](http://clubelo.com/)) 
to calculate probability of win/draw/loss of each game and record teams' final league position, as well as qualification for European competitions
and relegation.

Currently only Liga NOS (Portuguese 1st League) has been implemented.
